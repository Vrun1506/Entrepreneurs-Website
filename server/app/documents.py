"""CV document validation.

Unlike images.py, this module never re-encodes anything — a CV's stored
bytes ARE the original upload, because the eventual matching pipeline
(cv-matchmaker-spec.md, principle 6: "pipeline must be re-runnable from
stored text") needs to be able to go back to the source file, and because
re-encoding a PDF or DOCX in any real sense means re-authoring it, which is
not a thing this gateway is in the business of doing.

That makes this the higher-trust path of the two the gateway serves: an
image's pixels are the only thing that survives sanitise(), but a CV's
bytes are stored verbatim, and whoever downloads it — the member
themselves, or an admin — gets exactly what was uploaded. The checks below
exist to keep that file from being something other than what it claims:

  * magic bytes decide the format, never Content-Type or filename — the
    same rule images.py follows, for the same reason.
  * .docm is rejected even though it is byte-for-byte a valid .docx
    container: Office macros are executable code, and nothing about
    "upload your CV" should be able to deliver a macro payload to whoever
    opens it next.
  * a zip bomb (a small file that expands enormously) is rejected by
    comparing declared uncompressed size against the compressed size,
    mirroring the pixel-count guard images.py applies to images.
  * an encrypted PDF is rejected — this gateway has no password to open it
    with, and a member cannot review or the matcher parse content it can't
    read either.

PDF embedded JavaScript and /Launch actions are rejected outright, the same
way a macro-enabled .docm is: both are executable payload riding inside a
document upload, and "inert in a browser" doesn't mean inert everywhere —
Content-Disposition: attachment only stops inline rendering, and a PDF
reader that isn't a browser (Adobe Acrobat, chiefly) does run embedded
JavaScript and can act on a /Launch action. This is the well-known
malicious-résumé attack shape, and it's aimed squarely at whoever has the
most reason to open a stranger's CV — an admin. Detected with pikepdf
(qpdf-backed) rather than a byte search, because the earlier /Encrypt-only
check that shipped here shared a real weakness with that shape of check:
it can't see through a PDF's own object-stream compression, so anything
encoded that way — a real encryption dictionary, or a JavaScript action —
would silently pass a plain substring search.
