"""Foundry upload gateway.

Three endpoints and a health check:

    POST /v1/images        member uploads an image (post/avatar), authorised
                            by a ticket
    POST /v1/documents      member uploads a CV, authorised by a ticket
    POST /v1/blobs/delete   the deletion drain removes keys, service-to-service
    GET  /health            liveness

Everything the gateway knows about identity arrives in a signed ticket. It
holds no database connection and no Supabase client, on purpose: the only
thing it can do is turn bytes into a sanitised WebP or a validated document
at a key it was told to use, in the one container that ticket's purpose
maps to, which keeps the blast radius of a compromise to this container.
