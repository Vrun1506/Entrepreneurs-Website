# 08 · Retention Decision Record — Moderation Log Surviving Erasure

> **Status:** DECIDED — approved 30 August 2026. See §7.
> **Decision owner:** a director of IC Founders Ltd (the data controller).
> **Reviewer:** Imperial College London Data Protection Office.
> Nothing here is legal advice. This records a decision and its reasoning so
> that the reasoning is auditable later, not only the outcome.

## 1. The decision being asked for

When a member deletes their Foundry account, everything they wrote is
destroyed. **One exception is proposed:** if a moderator has previously removed
one of their community posts, the record of that removal survives.

That record is `public.post_moderation_log`. Concretely, this means the
platform can be in a position of saying:

> *"We deleted your account. We have kept a record that we removed a post of
> yours, why we removed it, and what it said."*

That sentence is the whole of what needs approving. Everything below explains
why it is proposed and what it costs.

## 2. What is actually retained

One row per **admin takedown**. Not per post, not per deletion — a member
deleting their own post, and the automatic 7-day expiry, write nothing here.

| Column | Content |
|---|---|
| `post_id`, `author_id` | Bare UUIDs. **No foreign keys** — see §4 |
| `author_email_snapshot` | The address at the time of removal |
| `admin_id` | Who removed it |
| `reason` | The moderator's stated reason, also emailed to the author |
| `title_snapshot`, `body_snapshot` | The post as published |
| `image_count`, `posted_at`, `removed_at` | Context |
| `purge_after` | Defaults to `now() + 12 months` |
| `legal_hold` | Boolean, default false |

The table has **no RLS policies at all**, so it is unreadable by the
application — including by admins through the app. Reading it requires the
service role or direct database access.

Images are **not** retained. The takedown destroys them like any other
deletion, and the log records only that there were *n* of them.

## 3. Lawful basis proposed

**UK GDPR Article 17(3)(e)** — the right to erasure does not apply where
processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal
claims.

The claims contemplated are real and specific to a platform of this kind:

- A member appeals a removal, months later, and we must show what was removed
  and why. Without the snapshot, "we removed a post for reason X" is close to
  worthless — and an appeal is the *only* time this table is ever read.
- A third party complains that we hosted defamatory, harassing or illegal
  material. We must be able to show it was removed, when, and on what grounds.
- Ofcom, under the Online Safety Act, asks how the service handled illegal
  content. Record-keeping is an express duty, not an optional practice.
- A member alleges the platform moderated them unfairly or discriminatorily.
  The record is as much the member's protection as ours.

Retention is bounded at **12 months**, enforced by `purge_moderation_records()`
on a nightly cron. `legal_hold` allows one record to outlive the window when a
claim is actually live, so the purge never has to be disabled for everybody in
order to preserve one row.

## 4. Why there is no foreign key

`author_id` is stored as a bare UUID rather than a reference to `auth.users`.

This is deliberate and it is the crux of the decision. If it cascaded, a member
could destroy the record of their own moderation by deleting their account —
and the case this record exists for is precisely the one where that member has
a reason to want it gone.

The codebase already sets this precedent: `admin_actions.target_id` is
FK-free for the same reason, so that audit rows survive the deletion of what
they describe.

## 5. What this costs the data subject, honestly

The argument against should be stated as strongly as the argument for.

- **The erasure is not complete.** A member who asks to be forgotten is not
  entirely forgotten. Their name is gone; their email address, one post, and
  the fact they were moderated are not.
- **It is retained without consent** and cannot be objected away, because
  17(3)(e) is an exemption rather than a balancing test.
- **`body_snapshot` retains content we told them was deleted.** This is the
  sharpest point. The post is gone from the site, the images are destroyed,
  but the words persist in a table for up to a year.

Mitigations already implemented: the 12-month ceiling is enforced by code, not
policy; the table is unreadable by the application; the takedown email tells the
author a record is kept for 12 months, so it is not a surprise; and the log is
written **only** for admin takedowns, never for a member's own deletion or for
routine expiry.

## 6. Alternatives considered

| Option | Why not |
|---|---|
| Delete the log on account deletion | Makes the record destroyable by the person it is about, at exactly the moment it matters |
| Keep the row, drop `body_snapshot` | An appeal cannot be answered without knowing what was actually removed |
| Pseudonymise `author_id` | A one-way hash we can still match against is not anonymisation; a hash we cannot match is the same as deleting the row |
| Retain 6 years (limitation period) | Disproportionate. 12 months covers appeals and regulatory questions; longer is hoarding |
| Retain 3 months | Shorter than a plausible complaint-to-escalation cycle, and shorter than Ofcom might expect |

## 7. Sign-off

| | |
|---|---|
| **Decision** | ☑ **Approved as written** ☐ Approved with amendments ☐ Rejected |
| **Approved by** | Varun Nayak, director, IC Founders Ltd ⚠ *confirm exact name and title as registered at Companies House* |
| **Date** | 30 August 2026 |
| **Imperial DPO reviewed** | ☐ Not yet — to be submitted with the portfolio |
| **Amendments** | None |

**Reasoning recorded at the time of the decision.** The record exists for the
case where its subject has a motive to erase it; making it destroyable by that
person means it is not a record. Proportionality rests on three facts: only
admin takedowns write here, so the volume is a handful of rows a year rather
than a retention scheme; the window is twelve months, enforced by cron, against
a six-year limitation period for many civil claims; and the author is told at
the moment of removal that a record is kept, so it is disclosed rather than
discovered.

The narrower option — keeping the metadata but dropping `body_snapshot` on
account deletion — was considered and rejected. It reads as the proportionate
compromise and fails the test it exists for: if a third party complains months
later, "we removed a post for harassment" without the post cannot show the
action was proportionate, and cannot answer an author who says we removed
something innocuous. The snapshot protects the member from the platform as much
as the platform from the member.

**This decision should be revisited** if the volume of takedowns stops being
small, if the membership opens beyond Imperial, or if the Imperial DPO takes a
different view on review.

If reversed later, the technical change is small and contained: add
`references auth.users(id) on delete cascade` to `post_moderation_log.author_id`
in a new migration. The table then disappears with the account. Everything else
in the Community feature is unaffected.
