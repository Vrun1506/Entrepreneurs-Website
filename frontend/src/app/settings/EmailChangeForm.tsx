// Change your email address.
//
// HOW GOTRUE ACTUALLY BEHAVES HERE, measured against a local stack whose
// auth config matches the hosted project. The previous version of this
// file described the opposite behaviour and shipped broken, so the
// measurement is recorded here rather than summarised.
//
// updateUser({ email }) writes the pending address to email_change and
// sends a 6-digit code to BOTH mailboxes. With "Secure email change" on
// (it is, in the hosted project) each code confirms one side and BOTH are
// required:
//
//   POST /verify { email: <current>, token: <old-inbox code> }
//     -> 200 {"code":"200","msg":"Confirmation link accepted. Please
//             proceed to confirm link sent to the other email"}
//        no user, no session. email_change_confirm_status 0 -> 1.
//        THE ADDRESS HAS NOT CHANGED.
//
//   POST /verify { email: <new>, token: <new-inbox code> }
//     -> 200 with a user and a session. auth.users.email now moves.
//
// TWO CONSEQUENCES, both of which the first version of this form got
// wrong.
//
// The new-address code is NOT unverifiable. It has to be sent addressed
// to the NEW address, because GoTrue looks that token up by email_change
// while the current-address token is looked up by email. Sending it with
// the current address fails, which is what "it cannot be verified" was
// mistakenly concluded from.
//
// A 200 IS NOT SUCCESS. The single-confirmation response is a 200, so
// supabase-js returns error: null and the old code treated that as a
// completed change — it showed a success screen while the account had not
// moved, and the member was then told to sign in with an address that did
// not exist. Nothing below reports success on the absence of an error;
// it reports success when the returned user actually carries the new
// address.
//
// WHY BOTH INBOXES IS THE RIGHT SHAPE. The old-address code is what stops
// someone on a stolen session moving the account to an address they
// control. The new-address code is what stops a typo moving the account
// to an address nobody can read. Neither alone covers both.
//
// There is no password step: Google accounts have no password identity,
// so it would have to be skipped exactly where it was meant to help. The
// old inbox is the reauthentication.
//
// The domain check runs before updateUser rather than relying on the DB
// trigger, because the trigger fires on the final write — by which point
// the member has already been asked for two codes. See
// lib/auth/imperialEmail.ts.
