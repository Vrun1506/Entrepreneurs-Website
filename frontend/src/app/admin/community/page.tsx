// Foundry · /admin/community → /admin/members
//
// This route was the admin view of the member directory. With a
// member-facing post feed now living at /community, the name meant two
// different things depending on whether it had /admin in front of it —
// so it has moved to /admin/members, matching the /members it manages.
//
// 307, not 308, matching the redirect /community itself used while it was
// waiting for the feed: a permanent redirect gets cached by browsers and
// intermediaries, and an admin who visited the old path once would be
// stuck with a cached hop long after this file is deleted.
//
// The query string is carried across because the directory's filters live
// in the URL, and admins have those links saved.
