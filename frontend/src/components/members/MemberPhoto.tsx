// Foundry · The large-photo treatment for a member's face, shared by the
// directory grid, the newest-members strip, and the profile dialog.
//
// Supersedes MemberAvatar's small-inline-circle pattern for these three
// surfaces — the avatar is already a 512×512 square blob (see
// AvatarCropper's OUTPUT constant), so showing it bigger needs no new
// cropping, just a bigger box. `aspect` lets a caller ask for a square
// (cards) or a wide banner (the dialog hero, where a literal square
// would be enormous next to the panel's own width).
