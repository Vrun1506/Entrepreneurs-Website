// Imperial Entrepreneurs logo + "Foundry" wordmark.

// Single source of truth for the brand mark across both the public
// marketing site and the authenticated app.
//
// The asset is /logo-lockup.png: the roundel and wordmark cut out of the
// original artwork with a real alpha channel. Two things that fixes.
//
//   * The old source was the full 2416x1270 canvas — mostly black field. At
//     `h-9` the roundel rendered about 12px tall inside a box of nothing.
//     This asset's bounding box IS the artwork, so the height prop means what
//     it says.
//   * It was composited with mixBlendMode:"screen" to knock the black out.
//     That only approximates transparency, and the source carried a 3px
//     #717171 frame on three edges which screen mode lifted into a visible
//     rectangle on every surface the mark appeared on.
