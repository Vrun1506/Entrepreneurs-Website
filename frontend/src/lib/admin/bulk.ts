 *
 * This used to call the single-item action per id, and each of those
 * re-authenticated (getUser + is_admin + a profiles select), enqueued its
 * own email, dropped the cache keys and revalidated both paths — roughly
 * six round trips per item, sequential, in no transaction. Clearing a
 * fifty-item backlog was three hundred round trips and would hit the
 * function timeout part-way through, leaving some items handled and some
 * not, with the admin shown nothing at all.
 *
 * Now: the caller authenticates once, one RPC per item, one bulk email
 * insert, one cache drop, one revalidate per path. Per-item results are
 * still collected, so a partial batch is reported rather than guessed at.
 *
 * Sequential on purpose: each item hits a SECURITY DEFINER RPC, so firing
 * them in parallel would multiply database load for no user-visible gain
 * on a selection this size. A failure doesn't abort the rest — a bad row
 * shouldn't strand the ones behind it in the queue.
