// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// Foundry · Intake answer drafts, in localStorage
//
// Per-viewer convenience, same precedent as components/app/Sidebar.tsx's
// collapsed-nav flag — not shared state, so it has no business in the
// Upstash cache (see lib/cache.ts's own header: that layer is only for
// responses identical for every member).
//
// photoBlob/photoPreview/cvFile are excluded: they aren't JSON-safe (a
// File/Blob or an object URL that dies with the tab that made it), and
// they're already covered a different way — confirm_avatar_upload and
// confirm_cv_upload persist to the DB the moment an upload finishes, and
// IntakeFlow re-hydrates "already uploaded" from the server on mount.
// Persisting them here would either throw or show a stale, broken image.
//
// suggestedSkillIds is excluded for the same reason: confirmCvUpload's
// background extraction persists it to cv_suggested_skill_ids, and
// IntakeFlow's own effect re-fetches it from there on arriving at the
// Skills screen. A stale array surviving in this draft — say, from a CV
// that has since been replaced — would otherwise block that re-fetch
// (it only runs while the in-memory value is still empty) and show
// suggestions for a CV that's no longer the one on file.
